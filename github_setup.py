Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Advanced Trading Platform! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git
- Basic understanding of trading concepts

### Development Setup
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advanced-trading-platform.git`
3. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
4. Activate virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/Mac) or `venv\\Scripts\\activate` (Windows)
5. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Start development services: `docker-compose up -d`

## 📋 Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused (max 50 lines)

### Testing
- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Maintain >90% test coverage
- Use pytest for testing framework
- Mock external dependencies (exchanges, APIs)
- Test both success and failure scenarios

### Documentation
- Update README.md for new features
- Add docstrings to all public APIs
- Update API documentation
- Include examples in documentation

### Security
- Never commit API keys or secrets
- Validate all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Follow OWASP security guidelines
- Conduct security review for all PRs

## 🔄 Contribution Workflow

### 1. Create Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Make Changes
- Write code following our guidelines
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Test Your Changes
```bash
# Run tests
pytest

# Run linting
flake8 .
black --check .
isort --check-only .

# Run security scan
bandit -r .
```

### 4. Commit Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new trading strategy framework"
```

Use conventional commit messages:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `test:` for test additions/changes
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `perf:` for performance improvements

### 5. Push and Create PR
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a pull request on GitHub.

## 🏗️ Architecture Guidelines

### Microservices
- Each service should have a single responsibility
- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Follow REST API conventions
- Use message queues for inter-service communication

### Database
- Use migrations for schema changes
- Index frequently queried columns
- Avoid N+1 queries
- Use connection pooling
- Implement proper backup strategies

### Trading Logic
- Implement proper risk management
- Use decimal arithmetic for financial calculations
- Handle exchange API rate limits
- Implement circuit breakers for external APIs
- Log all trading decisions and outcomes

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests
```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

def test_strategy_calculation():
    # Arrange
    strategy = MomentumStrategy(params={'period': 14})
    mock_data = create_mock_market_data()
    
    # Act
    signal = strategy.calculate_signal(mock_data)
    
    # Assert
    assert signal.action == 'BUY'
    assert signal.confidence > 0.7
```

### Integration Tests
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_strategy_marketplace_api():
    async with AsyncClient(app=app, base_url="http://test") as ac:
        response = await ac.get("/strategies")
        assert response.status_code == 200
        assert len(response.json()) > 0
```

## 📊 Performance Guidelines

### Optimization
- Profile code before optimizing
- Use caching for expensive operations
- Implement database query optimization
- Use async operations for I/O
- Monitor memory usage and prevent leaks

### Monitoring
- Add metrics for all critical operations
- Implement health checks
- Use structured logging
- Monitor API response times
- Track business metrics (trades, P&L, etc.)

## 🔒 Security Guidelines

### API Security
- Implement rate limiting
- Use JWT tokens for authentication
- Validate all inputs
- Implement CORS properly
- Use HTTPS in production

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use secure communication channels
- Implement proper access controls
- Regular security audits
- Follow data privacy regulations

## 📝 Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
```python
def calculate_sharpe_ratio(returns: List[float], risk_free_rate: float = 0.02) -> float:
    \"\"\"
    Calculate the Sharpe ratio for a series of returns.
    
    Args:
        returns: List of periodic returns
        risk_free_rate: Risk-free rate (default: 2%)
    
    Returns:
        Sharpe ratio as a float
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If returns list is empty or contains invalid values
        
    Example:
        >>> returns = [0.1, 0.05, -0.02, 0.08]
        >>> sharpe = calculate_sharpe_ratio(returns)
        >>> print(f"Sharpe ratio: {sharpe:.2f}")
    \"\"\"
```

### API Documentation
- Use OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
- Include request/response examples
- Document error codes and messages
- Provide authentication examples
- Include rate limiting information

## 🚀 Release Process
