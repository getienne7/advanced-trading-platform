# Smart Order Routing System - Implementation Summary

## Task Completion: 3.3 Build Smart Order Routing System

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Requirements Implemented**:

- **Requirement 2.5**: WHEN multiple exchanges are available THEN the system SHALL route orders to the exchange with best execution

- **Poor**: < 500ms
- **Unacceptable**: ≥ 500ms

#### 5. Exchange Health Monitoring

```python
async def _health_monitor(self):
async def _latency_monitor(self):
```

**Features**:

- ✅ Continuous health monitoring with configurable intervals
- ✅ Real-time latency tracking with exponential moving averages
- ✅ Success rate calculation and failure counting
- ✅ Automatic exchange recovery detection
- ✅ Health score calculation and categorization

**Monitoring Metrics**:

- Latency (response time)
- Success rate (reliability)
- Consecutive failures
- Uptime percentage
- Overall health score

## 🚀 Advanced Features

### 1. Routing Decision Caching

- 5-second TTL for routing decisions

### 2. Preferred Exchange Support

```python
async def _apply_preferred_exchanges(self, order: OrderRequest, candidates: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
```

- User-specified exchange preferences
- Preference order enforcement
- Fallback to non-preferred exchanges when needed

### 3. Comprehensive Metrics and Monitoring

- Prometheus metrics integration
- Routing decision counters
- Execution latency histograms
- Failover event tracking
