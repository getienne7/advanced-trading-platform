## Exchange-Specific Features

### Binance Connector

#### Spot Trading

```python
binance = BinanceConnector(api_key, secret_key, testnet=True)
await binance.initialize()

# Place spot order
order = await binance.place_order(
    symbol="BTC/USDT",
    side="buy",
    type="limit",
    amount=0.001,
    price=50000.0
)
```

#### Futures Trading

```python
# Place futures order
futures_order = await binance.place_futures_order(
    symbol="BTC/USDT",
    side="buy",
    type="limit",
    amount=0.001,
    price=50000.0,
    reduce_only=False
)

# Set leverage
await binance.set_leverage("BTC/USDT", leverage=10)

# Get positions
positions = await binance.get_futures_positions()
```

### Coinbase Pro Connector

#### Institutional Features

```python
coinbase = CoinbaseConnector(api_key, secret_key, passphrase, sandbox=True)
await coinbase.initialize()

# Advanced order with institutional features
order = await coinbase.place_advanced_order(
    symbol="BTC/USDT",
    side="buy",
    type="limit",
    amount=0.001,
    price=50000.0,
    post_only=True,  # Maker-only order
    time_in_force="GTT"
)

# Get detailed fills for reporting
fills = await coinbase.get_fills(order_id="order-123")

# Get funding records for accounting
funding = await coinbase.get_funding_records(currency="USD")
```

### Kraken Connector

#### Margin Trading

```python
kraken = KrakenConnector(api_key, secret_key)
await kraken.initialize()

# Place margin order with leverage
margin_order = await kraken.place_margin_order(
    symbol="BTC/USDT",
    side="buy",
    type="limit",
    amount=0.001,
    price=50000.0,
    leverage=5
)

# Get margin positions
positions = await kraken.get_margin_positions()
```

#### Conditional Orders

```python
# Place stop-loss order
stop_order = await kraken.place_conditional_order(
    symbol="BTC/USDT",
    side="sell",
    type="stop-loss",
    amount=0.001,
    trigger_price=45000.0,
    limit_price=44500.0
)

# Get detailed trade history
trades = await kraken.get_trade_history(
    start_time=datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7)
)
```

## Smart Order Routing

### Best Execution Algorithm

The system automatically finds the best exchange for order execution based on:

1. **Price**: Best bid/ask prices across exchanges
2. **Liquidity**: Available depth at desired price levels
3. **Latency**: Exchange response times and reliability
4. **Fees**: Trading fees and execution costs

```python
# Smart order routing
smart_order = await place_smart_order({
    "symbol": "BTC/USDT",
    "side": "buy",
    "type": "market",
    "amount": 0.1
})

# Returns execution details including:
# - Selected exchange and reason
# - Expected vs actual execution price
# - Liquidity score and slippage
```

### Failover Mechanism

Automatic failover ensures high availability:

```python
# Order with failover
failover_order = await place_order_with_failover(
    order_request,
    backup_exchanges=["coinbase", "kraken"]
)

# If primary exchange fails, automatically tries backup exchanges
```

## Arbitrage Detection

### Cross-Exchange Opportunities

```python
# Find arbitrage opportunities
opportunities = await get_arbitrage_opportunities(
    symbol="BTC/USDT",
    min_profit_pct=0.5
)

# Returns:
# - Buy/sell exchange pairs
# - Profit potential and execution prices
# - Liquidity analysis
```

### Real-time Monitoring

The system continuously monitors price differences across exchanges to identify profitable arbitrage opportunities with minimal latency.

## Error Handling and Resilience

### Exchange-Specific Errors

```python
from exchanges.base_exchange import (
    ExchangeError,
    RateLimitError,
    InsufficientBalanceError,
    InvalidOrderError,
    OrderNotFoundError
)

try:
    order = await exchange.place_order(...)
except RateLimitError:
    # Handle rate limiting with exponential backoff
    await asyncio.sleep(retry_delay)
except InsufficientBalanceError:
    # Handle insufficient balance
    logger.warning("Insufficient balance for order")
except ExchangeError as e:
    # Handle general exchange errors
    logger.error(f"Exchange error: {e.message}")
```

### Rate Limiting

Automatic rate limiting prevents API violations:

```python
# Built-in rate limiting per exchange
await exchange.check_rate_limit("place_order")
```

## Health Monitoring

### Exchange Health Checks

```python
# Basic health check
status = await exchange.get_status()

# Detailed health with performance metrics
health = await exchange.get_exchange_health()

# Returns:
# - Connection status
# - Market data latency
# - Account access status
# - Last successful operation timestamp
```

### Performance Metrics

The system tracks key performance indicators:

- **Latency**: Request/response times for each exchange
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful operations
- **Error Rate**: Frequency and types of errors
- **Throughput**: Requests per second capacity

## Configuration
